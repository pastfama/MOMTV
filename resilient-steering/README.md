# Resilient Steering Agent — Responses Protocol

This sample demonstrates a **crash-resilient, steerable** long-running agent built with [azure-ai-agentserver-responses](https://pypi.org/project/azure-ai-agentserver-responses/). It shows how the cancellation policy and the crash-recovery contract **compose** when steering, client cancel, and shutdown interleave with crash recovery.

Two opt-in options drive the behavior (both default to `False`):

- **`resilient_background=True`** — a `store=true, background=true` response survives process crashes. The framework persists handler progress and re-invokes the handler on the next process start if a prior attempt did not reach a terminal event.
- **`steerable_conversations=True`** — a client can POST a new turn on an in-flight conversation. The running handler is woken via the cancellation signal (distinguished by `context.pending_input_count > 0`), winds the current turn down cleanly, and the framework re-invokes with the new input.

Recovery here is deliberately **naive**: the handler wraps a non-deterministic upstream (an LLM) and does **not** checkpoint partial output, so recovery needs no special code — every entry builds a fresh stream and re-runs the turn from scratch. The fresh `response.in_progress` (empty output) is the client-visible reset. A `turn_count` watermark on `context.conversation_chain_metadata` survives crashes and turn boundaries.

The LLM is **simulated** so the sample runs offline with no credentials — replace `_simulate_llm_stream` with a real model call to make it live.

## How It Works

```
POST /responses {input, store:true, background:true}
      │
      ▼
   turn 1 ──► stream tokens ──► completed
      │
      ├─ (new POST, same conversation)  ─► STEER ─► wind down turn 1 ─► re-invoke with new input ─► turn 2
      ├─ (client cancel)                ─► framework forces "cancelled"
      └─ (process crash / shutdown mid-stream) ─► exit_for_recovery ─► re-run turn from scratch on restart
```

## Cancellation surfaces (mutually exclusive)

| Signal | How the handler sees it | Response |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Steering** (new turn queued) | `cancellation_signal` set **and** `context.pending_input_count > 0` | Close builders, `emit_completed()` — partial output becomes context for the next turn |
| **Client cancel** | `cancellation_signal` set, `pending_input_count == 0` | Return without a terminal; framework forces `cancelled` |
| **Shutdown** | `context.shutdown.is_set()` (does **not** fire the cancellation signal) | `await context.exit_for_recovery()` — defer to next-lifetime recovery |

## Option 1: Azure Developer CLI (`azd`)

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- Azure CLI installed and authenticated (`az login`)

### Run the agent locally

```bash
azd ai agent run
```

The agent starts on `http://localhost:8088/`.

### Invoke the local agent

```bash
# Basic turn.
curl -X POST http://localhost:8088/responses \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model": "agent", "input": "Explain quantum computing"}'

# Resilient + steerable turn (stored background response).
curl -X POST http://localhost:8088/responses \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model": "agent", "input": "Explain quantum computing", "store": true, "background": true}'
# -> {"id": "<id>", "status": "in_progress", ...}

# Steer — supersede the in-flight turn on the same conversation.
curl -X POST http://localhost:8088/responses \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model": "agent", "input": "Actually explain relativity", "store": true, "background": true, "previous_response_id": "<id>"}'

# Poll a background response.
curl http://localhost:8088/responses/<id>

# Cancel an in-flight response.
curl -X POST http://localhost:8088/responses/<id>/cancel
```

### Try the recovery path

Fire a simulated mid-stream shutdown; the framework re-invokes the handler on the next lifetime and the turn re-runs from scratch:

```bash
SIMULATE_SHUTDOWN_MS=200 azd ai agent run
```

### Deploy to Foundry

```bash
azd provision
azd deploy
azd ai agent invoke '{"model": "agent", "input": "Explain quantum computing"}'
```

Stream logs from the running agent:

```bash
azd ai agent monitor
```

For the full deployment guide, see [Azure AI Foundry hosted agents](https://aka.ms/azdaiagent/docs).

## Option 2: VS Code (Foundry Toolkit)

### Prerequisites

1. **VS Code** with the **[Foundry Toolkit](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-windows-ai-studio.windows-ai-studio)** extension installed.
2. For debugging Python in VS Code, install the **[Python](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python)** extension pack.

### Set up the Python virtual environment

- Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) and run **Python: Create Environment...** to create a virtual environment (or **Python: Select Interpreter** to use an existing one).
- Install dependencies:

  ```bash
  # use uv to accelerate
  pip install uv
  uv pip install -r requirements.txt

  # or pure pip
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

### Run and debug the agent

Press **F5** to start the agent. The **Agent Inspector** opens automatically — chat with the agent there.

### Or run manually, then open the Inspector

1. Sign in to Azure with the Azure CLI (`az login`).
2. Start the agent: `python main.py` (listens on `http://localhost:8088`).
3. Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) → **Foundry Toolkit: Open Agent Inspector**, then send a message.

### Deploy to Foundry

1. Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) → **Foundry Toolkit: Deploy Hosted Agent**. The extension reads `azure.yaml` to auto-populate settings.
2. Complete **Foundry Project Setup** if prompted.
3. On **Basics**, choose deployment method (**Code** or **Container**) and confirm the agent name.
4. On **Review + Deploy**, confirm runtime details, pick **CPU and Memory** size, and click **Deploy**.
5. After deployment, invoke the agent in the Agent Playground and stream live logs from the **Logs** tab.

## Notes

- This sample ports the resilient-steering pattern from the [azure-sdk-for-python resilient Responses samples](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/main/sdk/agentserver/azure-ai-agentserver-responses/samples).
- To wire a real model, replace `_simulate_llm_stream` with a streaming call to Azure OpenAI via `AIProjectClient(...).get_openai_client()`, and set `AZURE_AI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME`.
